# Introduction
This is a state estimator for legged robots using [Invariant EKF estimation](https://github.com/RossHartley/invariant-ekf) with leg odometry in which the robot dynamics and kinematics are computed via [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)

# Requirement
- [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)
- devel branch of [invariant-ekf](https://github.com/mayataka/invariant-ekf) (forked from [original repo](https://github.com/RossHartley/invariant-ekf))

# Example: 
State estimation for [Whole-body MPC](https://github.com/mayataka/robotoc)
